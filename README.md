# Jeopardy-Game-Project

Overview

For project #1, I created a Jeopardy Game.

Once players come to the site,
they are asked if they would like to start a new game.
All the Cateorgies will be displayed.
the player will choose a Cateorgy and then the amount of money they
would like to play for.
example cateorgy one for $400.
The higher the value the harder the question.
When the question appears, player will be prompt with 4 mulitpule choice answers.
If player chooses the correct answer a green check mark will appear and
the player will accumlate the amount of points the question was for,
if the player chooses the wrong answer, a red x will appear.
the correct answer, no points will be accumalted for wrong answers.
At the end of the game the player will see their total amount of points.
if the players points are over a certian amount the will see a happy message
if under a certian amount a message will appear encouraging them to try again.
